## Understanding Arthritis and Its Symptoms

### What is Arthritis?
Arthritis is a term that encompasses over 100 different conditions that involve inflammation of the joints. The most common types of arthritis include osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage, often due to wear and tear from age or repetitive use. In contrast, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system attacks the synovium, the lining of the joints, leading to inflammation and joint damage.

The prevalence of arthritis is significant, affecting millions of people worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 54 million adults in the United States have been diagnosed with some form of arthritis, making it a leading cause of disability. This condition does not discriminate, affecting individuals across various demographics, including age, gender, and ethnicity, although it is more prevalent in older adults and women.

### Common Symptoms of Arthritis
The symptoms of arthritis can vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. However, some common symptoms include:

- **Joint Pain and Stiffness:** One of the hallmark symptoms of arthritis is persistent joint pain, which can worsen with activity or after periods of inactivity. Stiffness, particularly in the morning or after sitting for extended periods, is also common.
  
- **Swelling and Inflammation:** Inflammation in the affected joints can lead to visible swelling, warmth, and redness. This inflammation is a direct response to the body's immune system attempting to address the perceived threat.

- **Reduced Range of Motion:** Arthritis can lead to a decrease in flexibility and range of motion in the joints. This limitation can hinder daily activities and reduce overall quality of life.

Understanding these symptoms is crucial for early diagnosis and effective management of arthritis, paving the way for treatment options that can alleviate discomfort and improve joint function.

## Understanding Arthritis and Its Symptoms

### What is Arthritis?

Arthritis is a term that refers to a group of more than 100 different conditions affecting the joints, which are the areas where two bones meet. The most prevalent types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage, the protective tissue at the ends of bones. This condition typically occurs due to wear and tear over time and is often associated with aging. On the other hand, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder where the bodyâ€™s immune system mistakenly attacks the synovium, the lining of the membranes that surround the joints, leading to inflammation and pain.

Arthritis affects a significant portion of the population, making it one of the most common chronic conditions. According to various studies, it is estimated that over 54 million adults in the United States are diagnosed with some form of arthritis. The prevalence of this condition increases with age, and it is more common among women than men.
