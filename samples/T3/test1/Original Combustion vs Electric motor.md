# Overview of Combustion Engines

## Definition and Functionality

A combustion engine is a type of engine that converts fuel into mechanical energy through the process of combustion. This process involves burning fuel to create high-pressure gases that push against engine components, ultimately generating motion. Combustion engines can be categorized into two main types based on their combustion process: internal combustion engines and external combustion engines. 

Internal combustion engines operate by burning fuel within the engine itself, while external combustion engines burn fuel outside the engine to produce steam or other gases that drive the engine. The internal combustion engine typically follows a four-step process: intake, compression, operation, and exhaust. During the intake phase, air and fuel enter the combustion chamber; in the compression phase, this mixture is compressed to increase efficiency; the operation phase involves igniting the mixture to produce power; and finally, the exhaust phase expels the byproducts of combustion.

## Types of Combustion Engines

There are several types of combustion engines, each with its unique characteristics and applications:

- **Gasoline Engines**: These engines use gasoline as fuel and are commonly found in cars and motorcycles. They typically operate on the Otto cycle, which involves a spark plug to ignite the air-fuel mixture.

- **Diesel Engines**: Diesel engines use diesel fuel and operate on the Diesel cycle. They are known for their fuel efficiency and are often used in heavy-duty vehicles, such as trucks and buses, due to their ability to produce high torque.

- **Rotary Engines**: Also known as Wankel engines, rotary engines use a triangular rotor that moves in an epitrochoidal motion within a chamber. This design allows for a compact engine with fewer moving parts, but they are less common than traditional piston engines. 

In summary, combustion engines play a significant role in various applications, particularly in the automotive industry, where they compete with electric motors for efficiency and performance.
